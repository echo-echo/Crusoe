# Crusoe
*The modern message in a bottle*

Crusoe is a location based messaging app where users can read messages in their area and create messages that wander around as if the world was one big ocean.

#Getting Started
To get started: fork, clone or download the repo. Then, in terminal run `Meteor`. This will launch the app on localhost:3000. In order for the picture functionality to work, you will need to fill out the `key.template.js` file in the server folder. You will need to rename this file to `keys.js`
